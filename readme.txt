The dataset is from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data. The dataset contains various attributes about houses sold between 2006 and 2010, and it's intended to be used for predicting the sales price of each house. 

Currently the visualization includes a heatmap of the number of houses sold in each year broken down by the year the houses were built. Users can mouseover each tile to see the exact count. Users can also click on a tile to bring up charts visualizing certain attributes of houses sold in that year.
